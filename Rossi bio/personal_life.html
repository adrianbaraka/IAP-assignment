                After leaving the family home in Tavullia, he moved to Milan, before taking up residency in London, England during his period with Honda.

                In 2002 he received threats from an Italian-Spanish anarchist movement, which in those days sent parcel bombs to people it considered targets in either of the two countries. 
                The anarchists considered Rossi "guilty" because at the time he rode for Honda's MotoGP factory team, it had been sponsored by the oil company Repsol since 1994,
                (for which he filmed a commercial in Spain.) with their logo displayed on both the motorcycle and on his race suits.

                On 31 May 2005 he received an honorary degree in Communications and Advertising for Organizations. 
                In March 2010, the Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini delivered to Rossi the first Winning Italy Award for his contribution to the promotion of Italy's image in the world.
